# Executive Summary
The goal of this lab is to increase your understanding of various types of networks and networking and to educate you on which networks arethe best for different purposes.

# LucidChart

Create a new blank diagram (ignore message boxes to upgrade) and create a flowchart for a computer program that
asks for a number and then
* prints "Big" if the number is greater than 10
* prints "Small" if the number is less than 10.
Use the following resource (or one of your choice) as a guide: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/programming_methodologies/programming_methodologies_flowchart_elements.htm Add a textbox to the chart with your name

Download your chart as a jpg file and name it: DecisionFlowchart and upload the file to your GitHub lab folder

Share your experience using Lucidchart in a paragraph (3-4 lines)
* My chromebook has administrative restrictions that I haven't been able to bypass; I wasn't able to make the LucidChart of access the website to do so

# Networking
## Intro to Networking
Data Transmission

Match the following words with their definitions 

Words:
* Packet
* Packet-Switching
* IP Address
* DNS
* Protocol

Definitions to match:
* Set of rules to allow devices to communicate: Protocol
* Unit of data: Packet
* Unique identifying number: IP Address
* Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination address: Packet-Switching
* Directory of IP address common names. (For example 54.239.26.214 might be the IP address of amazon.com): DNS

## Network Hardware
* Explain the benefit of a switch over a hub.
  * A switch allows you to connect multiple types of devices to a singular computer network while a hub is really only effective in connecting multiple PCs to the same network
* Explain the benefit of a router over hubs and switches.
  * A router connects multiple networks, meaning that it can trasnfer data between different networks; this is a capability that the hub and switch do not have.

## Network Topology
* Explain: Single point of failure and the topologies that experience this issue.
  * A single point of failure occurs in technologies that have series circuits or bottlenecks, since in a series the failure of one circuit to pass an electrical impulse to the next in the series makes the entire circuit fail to function; hence the phrase "single point of failure."
* Compare the Infrastructure Topology and Wireless Mesh. Which do you think is better and why?
  * I think a wireless mesh is better because it has the centralization in the Infrastructure Topology as well as its resistance to failure if devices are removed from it, while also having a greater range on average and enabling wireless roaming in office or even home situations.
# Conclusion
This lab was very interesting to me, as almost everything included in this lesson was new to me. I had heard of wireless mesh before, but I had never actually researched what it actually did other than connect my devices. To be honest, I found it fascinating because beforehand I had no idea what was happening.
